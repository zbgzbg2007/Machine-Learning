# Machine-Learning
Projects or classes about ML

- CS231n folder includes all three assignments from the Stanford course CS231n.

- Easy21 folder includes the assignment Easy21 from the UCL course Reinforcement Learning.

- DQN folder includes my implementation of the deep Q-network, double Q-learning and deuling network for the Atari game
  Enduro based on the toolkit OpenAi gym.

- A3C folder includes my implementation of the asynchronous advatage actor-critic algorithm based on the Atari game Enduro.

- PPO folder includes my implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm based on Roboschool environments.

- Roboschool folder includes my implementation of three different algorithms based on Roboschool environments: A3C, PPO and a variant of DDPG (deep diterministic policy gradient). These are used to compared them based on the environment in Roboschool.
